# Knowledge

This is Lat's own working knowledge graph: the architecture, constraints, and test intent that document and drive the evolution of Lat itself.

Public [[docs]] explain how to use the product. This directory records what the implementation must do and why, and source/test `@lat:` references keep those decisions connected to code. It is both the subject and a real-world demonstration of Lat.
